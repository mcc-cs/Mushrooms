The data set MUSHROOMS.csv is all about the some historical data to identify whether the Mushroom is a Poisonous or Non-Poisonous one. 
Its a Suervised Classification problem with 23 columns including the label column. The data set was having more categorical text columns, which has been converted to numerical form by using LabelEncoder. 
Done with required EDA
Finally there were 23 columns in the the Train dataset and 1 column in Test dataset.
Data has been split into Train and Test before modelling.
Data has been visualised to get the insights of the model, but there were no such out comes after visualization.
As a future enhancement we can design Dashboard using PowerBI
Since its a SUpervised Classification problem, I tried modelling with different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decission Tree classifier, RandomForest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbour, Naive BAyes and SVM
Conclusion is K-Nearest Neighbour and Random Forest are having the best model fit for the Data set of finding whether the MUSHROOM is poisonous or nonpoisous with an accuracy of 99% for test data set and 100% for Train data, for K-Nearest neighbor algorithm. 99% accuracy gained for the test data set and 98% for Train data set for Random Forest classifier algorithm
